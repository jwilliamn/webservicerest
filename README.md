# Web Service Implementation
I have been developing python apps, mostly backend apps. They work just as I want. 
But recently I needed to integrate my python apps to apps written in other languages. Eventhough that there are tools that can help us with the task, it is quite difficult at least for someone who is not a developer. 
To do the integration an easy task I adopted what cloud App providers do. Provide services through an API to the client application.

Since I am new to web services I'll start from basic implementation using Django Rest framework
