# Web Service Implementation
I have been developing python apps, mostly backend apps that run on a bash shell. They work just as I want. 
But recently I needed to integrate my python apps to apps written in other languages. Eventhough that there are tools that can help us with the task, I find it difficult. 
To do the integration an easy task I adopted what cloud App providers do. Provide services through an API to the client application.

Since I am new to web services I'll start from basic implementation using Django Rest framework
